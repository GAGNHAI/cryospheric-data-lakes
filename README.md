# Cryospheric Data Lakes
Big data tools to handle various cryospheric remote sensing datasets.

Find the underlying [data here](/data) used in this project (or at least links to the sources since they might be too big).

Examine the [code here](/code) which mingles with the data to give some (hopefully) nice scientifically meaningful outputs (whatever that means). You may find some interesting dockerfiles and python3 code inside (if that clicks with you).

Feel free to submit a pull request or issue (nice ways of saying hi!) if you'd like to see something in here that's not here yet.
