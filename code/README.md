# Code

## docker

Contains [docker](https://www.docker.com/) image files to run various components in a very standardized and reproducible way. I.e. **use** what is inside to mimic (if not outright mirror) the exact tools/software that will run the projects within this git repository.

## scripts

The raw and maybe messy scripts to do most of the stuff that needs to be done. I.e. python, bash, and various other command-line stuff. Probably not for the faint-hearted.
