# Tutorials

Some of the lessons I use to sharpen my tack. Stuff in this folder is meant to be messy, highly experimental, hard to follow and understand. I.e. probably not where you the area you should be looking at if you have better things to do.

### *Hint*

Psst! If you look under [/code/docker/atom-hydrogen-beta](/code/docker/atom-hydrogen-beta), I will have already installed (or will strive to install very soon!) the dependency libraries inside of the Atom text editor, so you can use that as the development environment. The trick is to have **docker** installed first, full instructions can be found at the [main page](/).
